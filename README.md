This repository has been created as a place to store the course work sumitted to the UCL faculty as part of the assigmnent for the CASA Module on GIS & Science. 

The maps were created using QGIS, and the analysis was performed via a combination of R Studio code and excel. 

An explaination of the relevant files is as follows: 

	1) QGIS project file = BakerlooLineAssessment.qgz
	
	2) The main cvs files ( with the exception of those available on the web) are contained in the CVS files.zip

	3) A number of different exel files were developed to analyse the data and produce various graphs. These are all contained in the Excel folder. The excel files are numbered sequentially and the file called [1. Excel_ReadMe_File.slsx] outlines how the spreadsheets fit together. 

	4) All the shapefiles developed as part of both the analysis and the creation of the maps are contained in [AssignmentShapefiles.zip] file. Some of these are key to the development of the maps and the extraction of the data, while others are background information. The key shapefiles are referenced in the Assigment document. 

	5) Seven separate bits of R Code were written - these are all loaded in the Assignment R Code folder
